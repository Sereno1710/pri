        "abstract": "Fevers - undifferentiated, often unacknowledged, is one of the largest morbidity afflicting in primary care settings and the overall healthcare ecosystem in India. FEVER is probably also the largest public health entity in terms of DALY - (Disability Adjusted Life Years) impacting the working population both in urban as well as rural areas; however, it remains unaddressed by public health programs, which are largely organized through vertical disease-focused national programs. The family physicians see a high volume of undifferentiated fevers throughout the year with seasonal and regional variations in India. Family doctors are not formally linked with the public health programs as India continues to march on selective primary care. Family physicians and medical officers are the most vulnerable for exposure to undifferentiated patient load. The first two health workers who died of COVID 19 in India (Indore) were practicing family physicians. Two mohalla clinic doctors tested positive in Delhi and two other general practitioners have been found to be infected in Mumbai. The media discussions have been on increasing capacity for critical care and the number of ventilators etc., It is also important for the governments to urgently review the functionality of PHCs, CHCs and district hospitals, and create a framework of partnership with standalone family physicians and general practitioners as well as nursing home, small hospitals to play a constructive role in managing the epidemic.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Influenza B virus infection is generally considered to be mild and is rarely associated pulmonary cardiovascular involvement in adults. However fatal complications may occur. CASE PRESENTATION: A 43-year-old previously healthy Taiwanese male came to our emergency department due to high fever, chills, general malaise and myalgia for about 4 days. An influenza rapid test from a throat swab was negative. Chest radiography showed mild left lung infiltration and levofloxacin was prescribed. However, progressive shortness of breath and respiratory failure developed 48 h later after hospitalization. Emergent intubation was performed and he was transferred to the intensive care unit where oseltamivir (Tamiflu, Roche) 75 mg orally twice daily was given immediately. In the intensive care unit, cardiac catheterization revealed normal coronary arteries. However, a markedly elevated cardiac enzyme level (Troponin I level was up to 71.01 ng/ml), a positive cardiac magnetic resonance imaging findings and no coronary artery stenosis led to the diagnosis of acute myocarditis. Subsequent real-time polymerase chain reaction of endotracheal aspirates was positive for influenza B. His condition gradually improved and he was successfully weaned from the ventilator on day 22. He was discharged without prominent complications on day 35. CONCLUSION: Influenza B infection is not always a mild disease. Early detection, early administration of antiviral agents, appropriate antibiotics and best supportive care, is still the gold standard for patients such as the one reported.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To describe our experience in children hospitalized with the pandemic Influenza A (H1N1) from Northern India. METHODS: The retrospective case study was conducted at the Pediatric ward and Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) dedicated to the children (aged 18 years or younger) with influenza-like illness (ILI) with positive laboratory test results for pandemic H1N1 by reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction assay. RESULTS: Between August 2009 and January 2010, a total of 100 children were hospitalized with suspected 2009 H1N1 influenza with Category \u201cC\u201d as described by the Government of India. Twenty five patients were positive for H1N1 and 9 for seasonal influenza A. The most common presentation (H1N1 positive) was with fever (100%), cough (100%), coryza (52%), respiratory distress (88%), vomiting (28%) and diarrhea (16%). One child presented with hypernatremic dehydration and seizures (Serum sodium 174 meq/l). Of the H1N1 positive hospitalized children, 7 (28%) had respiratory failure and required PICU admission, 4 (16%) required mechanical ventilation, and 3 (12%) died. The major radiological findings were bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and consolidation. All patients were treated with oral Oseltamivir suspension or capsule as per appropriate weigh band and supportive care as required. Two deaths were caused by refractory hypoxemia and one by refractory shock. CONCLUSIONS: The exact incidence of Pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza on morbidity and mortality is difficult to calculate since only Category \u201cC\u201d patients were screened.",

        "title": "Fever in Common Infectious Diseases",
        "abstract": "Infection of the upper airways is very common and is the most common acute illness evaluated in the outpatient setting. The infection is usually caused by viruses including rhinoviruses, influenza viruses, parainfluenza and respiratory syncytial viruses. Influenza is the only viral infection preventable by vaccination and occurs predominately during annual winter epidemics. Bacterial infection such as acute rhinopharyngitis is uncommon and usually presents with either persistent symptoms of an URTI lasting over a week or worsening course after initial improvement or acute onset with high fever and inflammatory changes confined to the pharynx. Fever is common in both bacterial and viral gastroenteritis. High fever is commonly present in many bacterial causes (e.g. Shigella, Salmonella, Shiga toxin-producing E. coli). Fever is often absent or low-grade in other diseases (e.g. enteropathogenic E. coli, cholera). Other febrile conditions cause diarrhoea and need to be differentiated. Fever in CNS infection is the most common presenting symptom in children beyond the neonatal age owing to the presence of inflammatory mediators, particularly IL-1 and TNF in the blood or within the CNS. In MCD, fever was the first symptom in children younger than 5 years and 94% developed fever at some point. Viral exanthems are common causes of febrile illness in children. More than 50 viral agents are known to cause a rash. Historically, exanthems were numbered in the order in which they were differentiated from other exanthems. Thus the first was measles; second, scarlet fever; third, rubella; forth, so-called Filatov-Dukes disease (no longer recognized as an entity); fifth, erythema infectiosum; and sixth, exanthema subitum. As more exanthems were described, numerical assignment became impractical.",

        "abstract": "Animal health governance faces new challenges as the ecology of infectious livestock diseases is changing (Tomley and Shirley 2009). Environmental and climate changes, intensification of livestock production, modification in land-use and agricultural practices, globalization of human travel, the development of the trade of livestock and livestock products have created conditions for an increase in the emergence and re-emergence of infectious agents in the last decades (Weiss and McMichael 2004; Randolph and Rogers 2010; Jones et al. 2008; Gibbs 2005). The frequency of emergence of new highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIV) has increased over the past 20 years, as well as the economic impact of associated outbreaks (Alexander and Brown 2009). Bluetongue virus serotypes have continuously increased their spatial distribution, specifically in a northern direction. Treatment-resistant strains, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), have appeared. Numerous infectious diseases such as foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) are endemic in many parts of the world, and may have a high impact on animal health and farmer livelihood. Moreover, they constrain the ability of affected countries to trade livestock and livestock-derived products. Production systems in developed countries are also vulnerable. For example, outbreaks of FMD in United Kingdom in 2001, classical swine fever in Holland in 1997/1998, and highly pathogenic avian influenza H7N7 in Holland in 2003 resulted in the loss of millions of animals, mainly as a result of culling of affected and exposed animals. Finally, infectious livestock diseases are a threat for public health: about 75% of human infectious agents that emerged in the last 25 years had an animal origin (King et al. 2006).",

        "abstract": "Objectives. To document clinical characteristics of influenza-like illness, reported use of health preventive measures and attitudes towards vaccination among patients with influenza-like illness in general practice during the influenza pandemic in 2009. Methods. Cross-sectional survey in general practice. Patients, who were identified as having influenza-like illness during the peak of the influenza pandemic activity in Norway, were eligible for inclusion in the study. A questionnaire was sent 2\u20134 weeks after the patients visit to the GP with influenza-like illness diagnosis during October to December 2009, from general practices in Norway. A sample of responders >18 years also had a blood test to check for serological response to the pandemic H1N1 virus. Results. Questionnaires were sent to 1324 patients, and 357 (27%) were returned. Fever (91% versus 49%, P < 0.01), cough (85% versus 73%, P = 0.016) and gastrointestinal symptoms (58% versus 38%, P < 0.01) were more frequent in the age group <18 years compared to older patients. Serological H1N1 responses were analysed in 72 patients; 34 (47%) were positive (haemagglutination inhibition assay titres \u226540). There were no statistically significant differences in symptoms between seropositive and seronegative patients. Women reported better adherence to personal protective measures, such as hand washing and cough etiquette than men. Women were also more concerned about possible adverse effects of the pandemic influenza vaccine than men. Conclusions. Discrimination between influenza and other viral upper respiratory tract infections is difficult in daily clinical practice, even during an influenza pandemic. A gender difference was found in reported precautions to prevent influenza.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The first case of 2009 pandemic influenza A or H1N1 virus infection in India was reported in May 2009 and in the Saurashtra region in August 2009. We describe the two waves clinicoepidemiological characteristics of children who were hospitalized with 2009 influenza A infection in the Saurashtra region. METHODS: From September 2009 to February 2011, we treated 117 children infected with 2009 influenza A virus who were admitted in different hospitals in Rajkot city. Real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test was used to confirm infection, and the clinico-epidemiological features of the disease were closely monitored. RESULTS: In the 117 patients, with a median age of 2 years, 59.8% were male. The median time from onset of the disease to influenza A diagnosis was 5 days, and that from onset of the disease to hospitalization was 7 days. The admitted patients took oseltamivir, but only 11.1% of them took it within 2 days after onset of the disease. More than one fourth (29.1%) of the admitted patients died. The most common symptoms of the patients were cough (98.3%), fever (94.0%), sore throat and shortness of breathing. Pneumonia was detected by chest radiography in 80.2% of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: In children with infection-related illness, the survival rate was about 71% after oseltamivir treatment. The median time for virus detection with real-time RT-PCR is 5 days. Early diagnosis and treatment may reduce the severity of the disease.",

The main presentation in both cases consisted of flu-like symptoms manifesting as, fever, arthralgias and myalgias. The virus was isolated in one case from a throat swab and in another case following a bronchoalveolar lavage. Both patients received oseltamivir at a dose of 75 mg orally twice day. The dose of oseltamivir was increased to 150 mg twice per day due to the lack of improvement or progression of symptoms. In one case, clinical symptoms resolved without sequelae. In the second case, pulmonary symptomatology continued to deteriorate, despite aggressive polymicrobial treatment, requiring mechanical ventilation and ultimately the patient died from respiratory failure. These cases highlight the potentially serious effect of the ongoing Influenza A/pandemic 2009/H1N1 pandemic in this very vulnerable population and the urgent need to establish emergency preparedness strategies by oncology and bone marrow transplantation staff to face this serious healthcare challenge.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Acute respiratory illnesses are a leading cause of global morbidity and mortality in children. Coinfection with multiple respiratory viruses is common. Although the effects of each virus have been studied individually, the effects of coinfection on disease severity or healthcare seeking are less well-understood. METHODS: A secondary analysis was performed of a maternal influenza vaccine trial conducted between 2011 and 2014 in rural southern Nepal. Prospective weekly active household-based surveillance of infants was conducted from birth to 180 days of age. Mid-nasal swabs were collected and tested for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus, influenza, human metapneumovirus (HMPV), coronavirus, parainfluenza (HPIV), and bocavirus by RT\u2013PCR. Coinfection was defined as the presence of two or more respiratory viruses simultaneously detected as part of the same illness episode. Maternal vaccination status, infant age, prematurity, and number of children under 5 in the household were adjusted for with multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: Of 1,730 infants with a respiratory illness, 327 (19%) had at least two respiratory viruses detected on their primary illness episode. Coinfection status did not differ by maternal vaccination status, infant age, premature birth, and number of children under 5 in the household. Of 113 infants with influenza, 23 (20%) had coinfection. Of 214 infants with RSV, 87 (41%) had coinfection. Overall, infants with coinfection had increased occurrence of fever lasting 4 or more days overall (OR 1.4, 95% CI: 1.1, 2.0), and in the subset of infants with influenza (OR 5.8, 95% CI: 1.8, 18.7). Coinfection was not associated with seeking further care (OR 1.1, 95% CI: 0.8, 1.5) or pneumonia (OR 1.2, 95% CI: 1.0, 1.6). CONCLUSION: A high proportion of infants experiencing their first respiratory illness had multiple viruses detected. Coinfection with influenza was associated with longer duration of fever compared with children with influenza alone, but was not associated with increased illness severity by other measures.

We evaluated whether social media reflects social uneasiness and fear during epidemic outbreaks and natural catastrophes. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Freely available epidemic data in Taiwan. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: We used weekly epidemic incidence data obtained from the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control and online search query data obtained from Google Trends between 4 October 2015 and 2 April 2016. To validate whether non-English query keywords were useful surveillance tools, we estimated the correlation between online query data and epidemic incidence in Taiwan. RESULTS: With our approach, we noted that keywords \u611f\u5192 (\u2018common cold\u2019), \u767c\u71d2 (\u2018fever\u2019) and \u54b3\u55fd (\u2018cough\u2019) exhibited good to excellent correlation between Google Trends query data and influenza incidence (r=0.898, p<0.001; r=0.773, p<0.001; r=0.796, p<0.001, respectively). They also displayed high correlation with influenza-like illness emergencies (r=0.900, p<0.001; r=0.802, p<0.001; r=0.886, p<0.001, respectively) and outpatient visits (r=0.889, p<0.001; r=0.791, p<0.001; r=0.870, p<0.001, respectively).

CONCLUSIONS: These results suggested that Google Trends can be a good surveillance tool for epidemic outbreaks, even in Taiwan, the non-English-speaking country. Online search activity indicates that people are concerned about epidemic diseases, even if they do not visit hospitals. This prompted us to develop useful tools to monitor social media during an epidemic because such media usage reflects infectious disease trends more quickly than does traditional reporting.",

        "abstract": "Emerging viral infections (EVI), and re-emergent variants of existing ones, are a growing threat to public health worldwide with outbreaks occurring sporadically especially in Africa associated with significant adverse ecological, socioeconomic and public health implications. These pathogens have devised evolved environmental adaptations, including the possession of genomic resistance mutations. Haemorrhagic fever viruses like Ebola, Marburg and Lassa fever viruses and respiratory pathogens like the avian and human influenza severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) viruses, most from zoonotic reservoirs, may significantly increase morbidity and mortality in the human population in the nearest future. Likewise, vector-borne zoonotic viral diseases including Rift Valley fever, yellow fever, dengue, chikungunya and West Nile, transmitted by arthropods from animal reservoirs, occur frequently in the tropics, exhibiting previously unseen patterns of infection and spread. These patterns are facilitated by many intrinsic factors like mutated sites in the viral genome, and external factors including urbanization, displacement, human migration and climate change. Emerging viruses can easily cross boundaries and pose severe threats to the human populations in new geographical areas. Here, we outline the features of common emergent viruses and factors facilitating their emergence, effects, control and sustained management in the environment.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Among pregnant women, pneumonia is the third-leading cause of death and the most common non-obstetric infection resulting in death. Pregnant women who become infected with influenza have hospitalization rates comparable to non-pregnant women with high-risk medical conditions. Other than influenza, little is known about the consequences of viral-related ARI on the pregnant woman and the fetus. Our objective was to determine the respiratory viruses causing ARI and their clinical outcomes during pregnancy. METHODS: Pregnant women in their second and third trimester were enrolled prospectively at a Houston clinic between October 1, 2015 and April 30, 2016 during their regular prenatal visits. Pregnant women were enrolled if they reported having symptoms of ARI or were healthy within the preceding two weeks. Nasal-pharyngeal secretions were evaluated for respiratory viruses by real time-PCR. Clinical outcomes and complications of illness were obtained at enrollment and two weeks after the initial visit. RESULTS: A total of 155 pregnant women were enrolled. The average age at enrollment was 30.7 years among women with ARI and 29.7 among healthy controls. Average gestational age at enrollment was 26.0 weeks among women with ARI and 26.3 among healthy controls. Among the 91 healthy controls, 10 (11%) tested positive for a respiratory virus, with rhinovirus (n = 6) being the most common of the viruses detected. On the other hand, of the 81 cases of ARI, 51 (63%) tested positive for a virus. The most frequently detected viruses were rhinovirus (n = 22), coronavirus (n = 14), and respiratory syncytial virus (n = 8). Twelve patients reported fever during the course of their ARI. Seventeen ARI patients reported at least one symptom of lower respiratory tract illness (LRTI). Of those patients with LRTI, two reported decreased fetal heart rate and one was hospitalized for her illness. CONCLUSION: Respiratory viruses were frequently detected in pregnant women with ARI. One-third of pregnant women with viral ARI had evidence of LRTI. Hospitalization and non-reassuring fetal heart tones were among the complications reported by pregnant women with LRTI. Viral ARI during pregnancy appears common and is associated with significant morbidity. DISCLOSURES: All authors: No reported disclosures.",

During an outbreak of such a disease, the environment that the infectious agent experiences is therefore changing due to the subsequent control measures taken. In our model, we introduce a general branching process in a changing (but not random) environment. With this branching process, we estimate the probability of extinction and the expected number of infected individuals for different control measures. We also use this branching process to calculate the generating function of the number of infected individuals at any given moment. The model and methods are designed using important infections of farmed animals, such as classical swine fever, foot-and-mouth disease and avian influenza as motivating examples, but have a wider application, for example to emerging human infections that lead to strict quarantine of cases and suspected cases (e.g. SARS) and contact and movement restrictions.",

From forty-two field samples, 33 samples in the RT-LAMP assay was detected positive, whereas three of which were not detected by RT-PCR. Furthermore, in 33 strains of PRRSV, an identical detection rate was observed with the RT-LAMP assay to what were isolated using porcine alveolar macrophages.

We asked if two resources: 1) free text, and 2) structured data from an electronic medical record (EMR) could complement each other to identify patients with pneumonia, an ARI severity landmark. METHODS: A manual EMR review of 2747 outpatient ARI visits with associated chest imaging identified x-ray reports that could support the diagnosis of pneumonia (kappa score = 0.88 (95% CI 0.82\u22360.93)), along with attendant cases with Possible Pneumonia (adds either cough, sputum, fever/chills/night sweats, dyspnea or pleuritic chest pain) or with Pneumonia-in-Plan (adds pneumonia stated as a likely diagnosis by the provider). The x-ray reports served as a reference to develop a text classifier using machine-learning software that did not require custom coding. To identify pneumonia cases, the classifier was combined with EMR-based structured data and with text analyses aimed at ARI symptoms in clinical notes. RESULTS: 370 reference cases with Possible Pneumonia and 250 with Pneumonia-in-Plan were identified. The x-ray report text classifier increased the positive predictive value of otherwise identical EMR-based case-detection algorithms by 20\u201370%, while retaining sensitivities of 58\u201375%. These performance gains were independent of the case definitions and of whether patients were admitted to the hospital or sent home. Text analyses seeking ARI symptoms in clinical notes did not add further value. CONCLUSION: Specialized software development is not required for automated text analyses to help identify pneumonia patients. These results begin to map an efficient, replicable strategy through which EMR data can be used to stratify ARI severity.",

        "title": "Mixed viral infections of the respiratory tract; an epidemiological study during consecutive winter seasons",
        "abstract": "The current study aimed to describe the molecular epidemiology of mixed respiratory viral infections during consecutive winter seasons in a tertiary care hospital. Patients with symptoms of respiratory tract infection were evaluated during the 2009\u20102011 and 2013\u201015 winter seasons. A clinical microarray technique was used for viral detection. Clinical and epidemiological data were correlated with mixed viral detection and the need for hospitalization. In 332 out of 604 (54.4%) evaluated patients (17.6% children) a respiratory virus was identified. Mixed viral infections were diagnosed in 68/332 (20.5%) patients with virus detection (66.2% mixed Influenza\u2010RSV infections). Mixed viral infections were more commonly detected in children (OR 3.7; 95%CI 1.9\u20105.6, P < 0.01) and patients with comorbidities. In logistic regression analyses, mixed viral infections were associated with younger age (mean age 30.4 years vs. 41.8 years, P \u2264 0.001) and increased rates of fever (OR: 2.7; 95%CI 1.04\u20107.2, P < 0.05) but no adverse outcomes or increased rates of hospitalization. High rates of mixed viral infections were noted during all winter seasons (especially Influenza and RSV) and were more common in younger patients. The clinical significance of mixed respiratory viral infection needs further elucidation.",

        "title": "A60 Revealing the evolution of virulence in RNA viruses",
        "abstract": "A combination of high rates of mutation and replication, coupled with strong natural selection, ensures that RNA viruses experience rapid genotypic and phenotypic evolution. Such a \u2018fast-forward\u2019 evolution enables viruses to rapidly adapt to new host species, evade host immune responses, and to develop resistance to anti-viral drugs. Similarly, rapid evolution allows viruses to attain new levels of virulence, defined as the ability to cause severe disease in hosts. We hypothesize that distinct viral groups share genetic determinants that modulate virulence that have been acquired through convergent evolution. Thus, common patterns reflecting changing virulence-related specific viral groups could be detected. The main goals for this project are (1) to understand how genetic and phenotypic diversity can be generated among different viral groups by analyzing the variation patterns and determining the selective forces behind them (impact in viral fitness) and (2) to understand how fixed mutations can modulate virulence within different viral groups by performing comparison of strains with differing virulence within a longitudinal timescale. The subject of the study is key emerging and re-emerging virus families of medical importance. Such groups include: Coronaviridae (severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome-associated coronaviruses), Picornaviridae (Hepatitis A virus), Flaviviridae (Yellow fever, West Nile, Hepatitis C, Dengue, and Zika viruses), Togaviridae (Rubella and Chikungunya virus), Bornaviridae (Borna-disease virus), Filoviridae (Ebola and Marburg viruses), Paramyxoviridae (Measles, Nipah, and Hendra viruses), Rhabdoviridae (Lyssaviruses), Arenaviridae (Lassa virus), Bunyaviridae (Hanta- and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever viruses), and Orthomyxoviridae (Influenza A viruses). Viral genomes collected at different time points, different hosts (human and their most closely related animal reservoirs) and different locations will be compiled. Extensive molecular evolutionary analyses will be carried out to infer gene expansion/contraction within groups, rates of evolution, and changes in selection pressure, including the detection of positive selected genes and sites (adaptive evolution). Positively selected sites will be mapped onto the viral protein structures to reveal their impact on function, and hence the location of potential virulence determinants. Virulence changes among particular viral strains and types will be defined and measured according to definitions based on an increase in: (1) transmissibility, (2) host tropism, (3) immune evasion, (4) morbidity and mortality, (5) drug resistance, and by the incorporation of epidemiological data to determine whether high or low virulence strains within different hosts and localities are spreading most efficiently in nature.",

        "abstract": "The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the incidence of viral respiratory infection in hospitalized premature newborn infants and to assess the role of coronaviruses. All hospitalized premature infants with a gestational age less than or equal to 32 weeks were included. Tracheal or nasopharyngal specimens were studied by immunofluorescence for coronaviruses, respiratory syncytial virus, adenoviruses, influenza and parainfluenza viruses. Forty premature infants were included; 13 samples were positive in 10 newborns (coronaviruses n = 10; influenza 1 n= 2; adenovirus n= 1). None was positive at admission. All premature infants infected with coronaviruses had symptoms of bradycardia, apnea, hypoxemia, fever or abdominal distension. Chest X\u2010ray revealed diffuse infiltrates in two cases. However, no significant difference was observed between infected and non\u2010infected premature infants for gestational age, birth weight, duration of ventilation, age at discharge, incidence of apnea or bradycardia. Nosocomial respiratory tract infection with coronaviruses appears to be frequent. The clinical consequences should be evaluated in a larger population.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There was a pandemic influenza around the world in 2009 including South Korea since last pandemic occurred four decades ago. We aimed to evaluate the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of this infection in childhood. METHODS: We evaluated the epidemiologic characteristics of all the subjects infected with the 2009 H1N1 influenza A virus (2,971 patients, \u2264 15 years of age), and the clinical and laboratory findings of the inpatients (217 patients, 80 had pneumonia) between 1 September 2009 and 31 January 2010 in a single hospital throughout the epidemic. RESULTS: The age distribution of all the subjects was relatively even. Over 90% of cases occurred during a two-month period. Two hundred and five patients (94.5%) received oseltamivir within 48 h of fever onset, and 97% of inpatients defervesced within 48 h of medication. The group with pneumonia included more males than females, and had higher leukocytes counts with lower lymphocyte differentials than the group without pneumonia. The white blood cell count and lymphocyte differential were associated with the severity of pneumonia. Corticosteroid treatment for severe pneumonia patients was highly effective in preventing disease progression. CONCLUSION: Children of all ages affected with even rates of infection, but males were predominant in pneumonia patients. Pneumonia patients showed lymphopenia and its severity was associated with the severity of illness. Our results suggest that the mechanism of lung injury in 2009 H1N1 virus infection may be associated with the host immune response.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Respiratory tract infections (RTI) are a significant cause of health problems, accounting for about 10% of consultations in returning travelers. Nevertheless, the precise microbial etiology is not identified in many cases. METHODS: Prospectively collected 63 respiratory specimens (sputum or throat swab) from patients presented with respiratory symptoms (cough, sputum, chest pain, dyspnea, tachypnea, or abnormal findings of chest auscultation) after travel were tested using multiplex real-time PCR. The FTD Respiratory pathogens 33 (Fast-track diagnostics, Ltd.) can simultaneously detect 33 different respiratory pathogens directly from respiratory specimens. This test ran in the PCR-Only mode on BD MAX\u2122 (Nippon Becton Dickinson Company, Ltd.) and LightCycler480 System (Roche). RESULTS: Fifty-nine consecutive cases were included in the study. Thirty-nine cases were diagnosed as non-specific upper respiratory tract infections, five cases were influenza, bronchitis, pneumonia, threecases was acute sinusitis, and one case was acute pharyngitis, dengue fever. Twenty-four cases had returned from travel in Southeast Asia, nine from Africa, and 8 from Latin America, seven from South Asia, six from middle east, threefrom North America, threefrom East Asia, 2 from Oceania, and one from Europe. Of the 59 specimens analyzed, 48 (81.4%) tested positive for pathogens whereas 11 tested negative. Commonly detected pathogens were Haemophilus influenzae (14 cases; 23.7%), influenza A (10 cases; 17.0%), rhinovirus (9 cases; 15.2%), Staphylococcus aureus (8 cases; 13.6%), Moraxella catarrhalis (8 cases; 13.6%), Streptococcus pneumonia, coronaviruses OC43, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae (4 cases; 6.8%, respectively). Multiple pathogens were detected in 30.5% of the specimens. In 14 cases (23.7%), both virus and bacteria were detected from one specimen. CONCLUSION: Not only viruses, bacterial pathogens were detected frequently than expected in the patients of RTI. Comprehensive molecular testing such as multiplex real-time PCR would change our understandings of epidemiology of RTI among travelers.

        "title": "Human temperatures for syndromic surveillance in the emergency department: data from the autumn wave of the 2009 swine flu (H1N1) pandemic and a seasonal influenza outbreak",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The emergency department (ED) increasingly acts as a gateway to the evaluation and treatment of acute illnesses. Consequently, it has also become a key testing ground for systems that monitor and identify outbreaks of disease. Here, we describe a new technology that automatically collects body temperatures during triage. The technology was tested in an ED as an approach to monitoring diseases that cause fever, such as seasonal flu and some pandemics. METHODS: Temporal artery thermometers that log temperature measurements were placed in a Boston ED and used for initial triage vital signs. Time-stamped measurements were collected from the thermometers to investigate the performance a real-time system would offer. The data were summarized in terms of rates of fever (temperatures \u2265100.4 \u00b0F [\u226538.0 \u00b0C]) and were qualitatively compared with regional disease surveillance programs in Massachusetts. RESULTS: From September 2009 through August 2011, 71,865 body temperatures were collected and included in our analysis, 2073 (2.6 %) of which were fevers. The period of study included the autumn\u2013winter wave of the 2009\u20132010 H1N1 (swine flu) pandemic, during which the weekly incidence of fever reached a maximum of 5.6 %, as well as the 2010\u20132011 seasonal flu outbreak, during which the maximum weekly incidence of fever was 6.6 %. The periods of peak fever rates corresponded with the periods of regionally elevated flu activity. CONCLUSIONS: Temperature measurements were monitored at triage in the ED over a period of 2 years. The resulting data showed promise as a potential surveillance tool for febrile disease that could complement current disease surveillance systems. Because temperature can easily be measured by non-experts, it might also be suitable for monitoring febrile disease activity in schools, workplaces, and transportation hubs, where many traditional syndromic indicators are impractical. However, the system\u2019s validity and generalizability should be evaluated in additional years and settings.

        "abstract": "Population density and immune status, vectors and virulence of infection, nutritional status, sanitation, genetic susceptibility and medical management of cases, are important factors influencing the incidence and/or severity of virus infections. Thus, the prevalence and clinical importance of virus infections and the need for antiviral drugs differ from place to place and from time to time. National and World Health Statistics of notifications of disease give some index of the incidence of infections but not all virus infections are notifiable. Such statistics can be misleading also through failures to notify from sloth on the part of the physician or, in the absence of pathognomonic symptoms or signs, from errors in diagnosis. Any assessment of the need for new antiviral drugs should consider the availability, safety, effectiveness and cost of alternative measures, including prevention of spread of infection by control of vectors, immunization by use of viral vaccines, or treatment with existing antiviral drugs. Early start of treatment of acute virus infections with existing drugs gives the best results and, where the clinical diagnosis is uncertain, accurate rapid virus diagnosis is of paramount importance. Many virus infections are asymptomatic or of trivial importance and without sequelae. However, new or improved antiviral drugs are needed for the prevention and/or treatment of a number of significant conditions caused by viruses which are not at present adequately controlled. These include upper and lower respiratory tract infections, influenza, chronic hepatitis, gastroenteritis, infectious mononucleosis, measles, rabies, haemorrhagic fevers and warts. Furthermore, such drugs might prove of therapeutic value in the prevention or treatment of virus-associated tumours, such as hepatoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, Burkitt's lymphoma, Kaposi's sarcoma and possibly carcinoma of the cervix.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: A deadly zoonotic Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) had emerged over the last 7 years in the Arabian Peninsula. As of February 28, 2018, 2,182 cases of MERS-CoV infection (with 779 deaths) in 27 countries were reported to WHO worldwide. The objectives of this study were to identify the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of MERS-CoV infection as well as determine its clinical outcome. METHODS: This was a retrospective-observational study of all laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection conducted at the main seven hospitals in the State of Qatar from January, 2012 to April 2018. We used the Fast Track diagnostics real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), targeting the upE and ORF1a genes respectively. Demographics, clinical information, potential contacts and probable risk factors were collected and analyzed by standard statistical methods. RESULTS: The mean annual incidence was 1.7 per 100,0000 person-years. Among the 24 confirmed cases of of MERS-CoV, males constituted the vast majority of cases (23 males) with a median age of 52 years (range 22\u201374). Fifty percent of the cases were Qatari and 42% reside in the same region. 67% of the cases had contact with camels, and 21% had contact with MERS-CoV-infected patient. Thirty-eight had travel history within 2 weeks of symptoms onset to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Fifty percent were smokers and 42% had comorbidities. The median symptoms duration was 4.5 days. Most of the patient presented with flu-like symptoms, were fever was the most common presentation, followed by cough, SOB, diarrhea, abdominal pain and headache, 96%, 83%, 33%, 8%, 8% and 4%, respectively. All patients were admitted to a tertiary hospital with a median hospital stay 41 days (8\u201397). Forty-five percent patients developed severe sepsis with multi-organ failure and needed ICU admission. Fifty percent patients developed acute kidney injury, 29% patients were on hemodialysis and 16% needed extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation. Thirty-three percent patients died. The rest of patients had recovered from the infection and discharged home. Among those who died all had one or more comorbidities. CONCLUSION: MERS-CoV infection is a rare infection in the State of Qatar, seen in both Qataris and expatriates with and without travel history. The infection in patients with comorbidities carries high mortality. DISCLOSURES: All authors: No reported disclosures.",

        "title": "Influenza",
        "abstract": "Influenza A and B viruses are orthomyxoviruses with three important envelope glycoproteins: hemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA), and matrix proteins. Influenza viruses have developed ways to evade the body's immune response using an antigenic variation known as antigenic shift (replacement of HA and NA antigens with novel subtypes from noninfluenza viruses) and drift (mutations within antibody-binding sites in HA and or NA). Because of new influenza viruses constantly emerging from antigenic shift and drift, new influenza vaccines are required each year. Human-to-human transmission of influenza occurs each winter and early spring through small-particle aerosols or droplets. The influenza virus attacks epithelial cells of the upper and lower respiratory tract, with the potential for secondary bacterial infection and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The symptoms of influenza infection include fever, headache, cough, sore throat, myalgia, and nasal congestion. Lower respiratory tract manifestations such as pneumonia and bronchiolitis are virtually indistinguishable from other viral infections. Children with certain comorbidities, such as chronic lung disease and severe neurologic impairment, are at higher risk of influenza-related complications. The most reliable test for influenza is reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Rapid antigen tests have lower sensitivity and specificity and are not reliable during periods of low influenza activity. Antiviral treatment with NA inhibitors can shorten the duration of fever, symptoms, and hospitalization, especially when started within 48 hours of influenza illness onset. Prevention of influenza through annual influenza vaccination is recommended for all children 6 months of age and older. The vaccines contain three or four influenza subtypes, chosen depending on the circulating strains. The two formulations approved for children are the inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) and live-attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV).",
