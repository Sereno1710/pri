        "abstract": "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome - Coronavirus - 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its related Coronavirus Disease - 19 (COVID-19) has become a health emergency worldwide. The medical community has been concerned since the beginning of the outbreak about the potential impact of COVID-19 in children, especially in those with underlying chronic diseases. Fortunately, COVID-19 has been reported to be less severe in children than in adults. However, epidemiologic and clinical data are scarce. Children show unique features of SARS-CoV-2 involvement that may account for the low rate of infection and death in this age group. The purpose of this review is to summarize the most relevant evidence of COVID-19 in children highlighting similarities and differences with adults.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND A SARS-CoV-2 outbreak affecting 52 people from a large school community in Santiago, Chile was identified (March 12), nine days after the first country case. We assessed the magnitude of the outbreak and the role students and staff played using a self-administered antibody detection test and survey. METHODS The school was closed on March 13, and the entire community was placed under quarantine. We implemented a home-delivery, self-administered, IgG/IgM antibody test and survey to a classroom stratified sample of students and all staff from May 4-19. We aimed to determine overall seroprevalence rates by age group, reported symptoms, contact exposure and to explore dynamics of transmission. RESULTS Antibody positivity rates were 9.9% (95%CI: 8.2-11.8) for 1,009 students and 16.6% (95%CI: 12.1-21.9) for 235 staff. Among students, positivity was associated with younger age (P=0.01), lower grade level (P=0.05), prior RT-PCR positivity (P=0.03), and history of contact with a confirmed case (P<0.001). Among staff, positivity was higher in teachers (P=0.01) and in those previously RT-PCR positive (P<0.001). Excluding RT-PCR positive individuals, antibody positivity was associated with fever in adults and children (P=0.02; P=0.002), abdominal pain in children (P=0.001), and chest pain in adults (P=0.02). Within antibody positive individuals, 40% of students and 18% of staff reported no symptoms (P=0.01). CONCLUSIONS Teachers were more affected during the outbreak and younger children were at higher infection risk, likely because index case(s) were teachers and/or parents from preschool. Self-administered antibody testing, supervised remotely, proved to be a suitable and rapid tool. Our study provides useful information for school re-openings.",

        "abstract": "Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) commonly cause mild upper-respiratory tract illnesses but can lead to more severe and diffusive diseases. A variety of signs and symptoms may be present, and infections can range in severity from the common cold and sore throat to more serious laryngeal or tracheal infections, bronchitis, and pneumonia. Among the seven coronaviruses that affect humans (SARS)-CoV, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, and the most recent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) represent potential life-threatening diseases worldwide. In adults, they may cause severe pneumonia that evolves in respiratory distress syndrome and multiorgan failure with a high mortality rate. Children appear to be less susceptible to develop severe clinical disease and present usually with mild and aspecific symptoms similar to other respiratory infections typical of childhood. However, some children, such as infants, adolescents, or those with underlying diseases may be more at-risk categories and require greater caution from clinicians. Available data on pediatric coronavirus infections are rare and scattered in the literature. The purpose of this review is to provide to clinicians a complete and updated panel useful to recognize and characterize the broad spectrum of clinical manifestations of coronavirus infections in the pediatric age.",

Virus excretion in asymptomatic people and in the pre-symptomatic phase of an infection is relevant for transmission- An effective antiviral therapy has not yet been established. Steroids for anti-inflammatory therapy are not recommended- It is very important to prepare all actors in the health care system for a longer-term burden of inpatients and complications and to create the necessary capacities. Low-threshold diagnostic testing and rapid detection of infection chains remain essential for better control of the pandemic. An effective vaccine is urgent.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND Worldwide, the number of SARS-CoV-2 infections is increasing. Serological immunoglobulin tests may help to better understand the development of immune mechanisms against SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 cases and exposed but asymptomatic individuals. The aim of this study was to investigate exposure to SARS-CoV-2, symptoms and antibody responses in a large sample of health care workers following a COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS A COVID-19 outbreak among staff members of a major German children's and women's hospital was followed by massive RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 tests and provided the opportunity to study symptoms, chains of infection and SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody responses (IgG and IgA) by ELISA. Study participants were classified as COVID-19 cases, and persons with close, moderate or no exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in the clinical setting, respectively. RESULTS Out of 201 study participants, 31 were COVID-19 cases. While most study participants experienced many symptoms indicative for SARS-CoV-2 infection, anosmia and coughing were remarkably more frequent in COVID-19 cases. Approximately 80% of COVID-19 cases developed some specific antibody response (IgA and IgG) approximately 3 weeks after onset of symptoms. Subjects in the non COVID-19 groups had also elevated IgG (1.8%) and IgA values (7.6%) irrespective of contact history with cases. CONCLUSION We found that a significant number of diseased did not develop relevant antibody responses three weeks after symptom onset. Our data also suggests that exposure to COVID-19 positive co-workers in a hospital setting is not leading to the development of measurable immune responses in a significant proportion of asymptomatic contact-persons.",

        "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 is a single-stranded RNA virus of ~30 kb genome size which belongs to genus Coronavirus and family Coronaviridae. SARS-CoV-2 has recently emerged and has been declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organization. Genomic characterization of SARS-CoV-2 has shown that it is of zoonotic origin. The structure of SARS-CoV-2 is found to be similar to SARS-CoV with virion size ranging from 70 to 90 nm. Spike, membrane, and envelope surface viral proteins of coronavirus are embedded in host membrane-derived lipid bilayer encapsulating the helical nucleocapsid comprising viral RNA. The genome comprises of 6\u201311 open reading frames (ORFs) with 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 flanking untranslated regions (UTRs). Sequence variation among SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV revealed no significant difference in ORFs and nsps. The nsps includes two viral cysteine proteases including papain-like protease (nsp3), chymotrypsin-like, 3C-like, or main protease (nsp5), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (nsp12), helicase (nsp13), and others likely to be involved in the transcription and replication of SARS-CoV-2. The structure of spike glycoprotein structure of SARS-CoV-2 resembles that of the spike protein of SARS-CoV with an root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of 3.8 \u00c5. Like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 uses the ACE2 receptor for internalization and TMPRSS2 serine proteases for S protein priming. Histopathological investigation of tissues from SARS-CoV-2 infected patients showed virus-induced cytopathic effect with signs of acute respiratory distress syndrome in lung cells. This chapter discusses about the morphology, genome organization, replication, and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 that may help us understand the disease that may leads to identification of effective antiviral drugs and vaccines.",

        "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 is a novel strain of coronavirus that has not been previously identified in humans. It has been declared a pandemic and has infected at least 1,844,683 individuals and caused 117,021 deaths as of 14th April 2020. Transmission among humans occurs via close contact with an infected individual that produces respiratory droplets. Patients have been shown to undergo acute respiratory distress syndrome, which is defined as cytokine storm. The diagnosis relies on detection of nucleic acid, IgG/IgM antibodies, and a chest radiograph of the suspected individuals. The genome of SARS-CoV-2 is similar to other coronaviruses that comprise of ten open reading frames (ORFs). SARS-CoV-2 spike protein exhibits higher affinity to ACE2 receptor as compared with SARS-CoV. Repurposing drugs like favipiravir, remdesivir, chloroquine, and TMPRSS2 protease inhibitors have been shown to be effective for the treatment of COVID-19. Personal protective measures should be followed to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, a clinical trial of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, mRNA-1273, has been started.

The pandemic spread of this zoonotic virus has created a global health emergency and an unprecedented socioeconomic crisis. The severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the illness caused by SARS-CoV\u20112, is highly variable. Most patients (~85%) develop no or mild symptoms, while others become seriously ill, some succumbing to disease-related complications. In this review, the SARS-CoV\u20112 life cycle, its transmission and the clinical and immunological features of COVID-19 are described. In addition, an overview is presented of the virological assays for detecting ongoing SARS-CoV\u20112 infections and the serological tests for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody detection. Also discussed are the different approaches to developing a COVID-19 vaccine and the perspectives of treating COVID-19 with antiviral drugs, immunomodulatory agents and anticoagulants/antithrombotics. Finally, the cardiovascular manifestations of COVID-19 are briefly touched upon. While there is still much to learn about SARS-CoV\u20112, the tremendous recent advances in biomedical technology and knowledge and the huge amount of research into COVID-19 raise the hope that a remedy for this disease will soon be found.

        "abstract": "The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV) was identified as the etiological agent of an acute respiratory disease causing atypical pneumonia and diarrhea with high mortality. Different types of SARS-CoV vaccines, including nonreplicative and vectored vaccines, have been developed. Administration of these vaccines to animal model systems has shown promise for the generation of efficacious and safe vaccines. Nevertheless, the identification of side effects, preferentially in the elderly animal models, indicates the need to develop novel vaccines that should be tested in improved animal model systems. Live attenuated viruses have generally proven to be the most effective vaccines against viral infections. A limited number of SARS-CoV attenuating modifications have been described, including mutations, and partial or complete gene deletions affecting the replicase, like the nonstructural proteins (nsp1 or nsp2), or the structural genes, and drastic changes in the sequences that regulate the expression of viral subgenomic mRNAs. A promising vaccine candidate developed in our laboratory was based on deletion of the envelope E gene alone, or in combination with the removal of six additional genes nonessential for virus replication. Viruses lacking E protein were attenuated, grew in the lung, and provided homologous and heterologous protection. Improvements of this vaccine candidate have been directed toward increasing virus titers using the power of viruses with mutator phenotypes, while maintaining the attenuated phenotype. The safety of the live SARS-CoV vaccines is being increased by the insertion of complementary modifications in genes nsp1, nsp2, and 3a, by gene scrambling to prevent the rescue of a virulent phenotype by recombination or remodeling of vaccine genomes based on codon deoptimization using synthetic biology. The newly generated vaccine candidates are very promising, but need to be evaluated in animal model systems that include young and aged animals.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The primary objective is to determine the efficacy of a single dose of ivermectin, administered to low risk, non-severe COVID-19 patients in the first 48 hours after symptom onset to reduce the proportion of patients with detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test from nasopharyngeal swab at day 7 post-treatment. 1. To assess the efficacy of ivermectin to reduce the SARS-CoV-2 viral load in the nasopharyngeal swab at day 7 post treatment. 2. To assess the efficacy of ivermectin to improve symptom progression in treated patients. 3. To assess the proportion of seroconversions in treated patients at day 21. 4. To assess the safety of ivermectin at the proposed dose. 5. To determine the magnitude of immune response against SARS-CoV-2. 6. To assess the early kinetics of immunity against SARS-CoV-2. TRIAL DESIGN: SAINT is a single centre, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, superiority trial with two parallel arms. Participants will be randomized to receive a single dose of 400 \u03bcg/kg ivermectin or placebo, and the number of patients in the treatment and placebo groups will be the same (1:1 ratio). PARTICIPANTS: The population for the study will be patients with a positive nasopharyngeal swab PCR test for SARS-CoV-2, with non-severe COVID-19 disease, and no risk factors for progression to severity. Vulnerable populations such as pregnant women, minors (i.e.; under 18 years old), and seniors (i.e.; over 60 years old) will be excluded. Inclusion criteria: 1. Patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in the emergency room of the Cl\u00ednica Universidad de Navarra (CUN) with a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR. 2. Residents of the Pamplona basin (\u201cCuenca de Pamplona\u201d). 3. The patient must be between the ages of 18 and 60 years of age. 4. Negative pregnancy test for women of child bearing age*. 5. The patient or his/her representative, has given informed consent to participate in the study. 6. The patient should, in the PI's opinion, be able to comply with all the requirements of the clinical trial (including home follow up during isolation). Exclusion criteria: 1. Known history of ivermectin allergy. 2. Hypersensitivity to any component of ivermectin. 3. Diagnosed by the attending physician. Identified in a chest X-ray. 4. Fever or cough present for more than 48 hours. 5. Positive IgG against SARS-CoV-2 by rapid diagnostic test. 6. Age under 18 or over 60 years. 7. Immunosuppression. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. Diabetes. Hypertension. Obesity. Acute or chronic renal failure. History of coronary disease. History of cerebrovascular disease. Current neoplasm. 8. Recent travel history to countries that are endemic for Loa loa (Angola, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Equatorial, Guinea, Gabon, Republic of Congo, Nigeria and Sudan). 9. Current use of CYP 3A4 or P-gp inhibitor drugs such as quinidine, amiodarone, diltiazem, spironolactone, verapamil, clarithromycin, erythromycin, itraconazole, ketoconazole, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, indinavir, ritonavir or cobicistat. Use of critical CYP3A4 substrate drugs such as warfarin. *Women of child bearing age may participate if they use a safe contraceptive method for the entire period of the study and at least one month afterwards. A woman is considered to not have childbearing capacity if she is post-menopausal (minimum of 2 years without menstruation) or has undergone surgical sterilization (at least one month before the study). The trial is currently planned at a single center, Cl\u00ednica Universidad de Navarra, in Navarra (Spain), and the immunology samples will be analyzed at the Barcelona Institute for Global Health (ISGlobal), in Barcelona (Spain). Participants will be recruited by the investigators at the emergency room and/or COVID-19 area of the CUN. They will remain in the trial for a period of 28 days at their homes since they will be patients with mild disease. In the interest of public health and to contain transmission of infection, follow-up visits will be conducted in the participant's home by a clinical trial team comprising nursing and medical members. Home visits will assess clinical and laboratory parameters of the patients. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Ivermectin will be administered to the treatment group at a 400\u03bcg/Kg dose (included in the EU approved label of Stromectol and Scabioral). The control group will receive placebo. There is no current data on the efficacy of ivermectin against the virus in vivo, therefore the use of placebo in the control group is ethically justified. MAIN OUTCOMES: Primary Proportion of patients with a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR from a nasopharyngeal swab at day 7 post-treatment. : 1. Mean viral load as determined by PCR cycle threshold (Ct) at baseline and on days 4, 7, 14, and 21. 2. Proportion of patients with fever and cough at days 4, 7, 14, and 21 as well as proportion of patients progressing to severe disease or death during the trial. 3. Proportion of patients with seroconversion at day 21. 4. Proportion of drug-related adverse events during the trial. 5. Median levels of IgG, IgM, IgA measured by Luminex, frequencies of innate and SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells assessed by flow cytometry, median levels of inflammatory and activation markers measured by Luminex and transcriptomics. 6. Median kinetics of IgG, IgM, IgA levels during the trial, until day 28. RANDOMISATION: Eligible patients will be allocated in a 1:1 ratio using a randomization list generated by the trial statistician using blocks of four to ensure balance between the groups. A study identification code with the format \u201cSAINT-##\u201d (##: from 01 to 24) will be generated using a sequence of random numbers so that the randomization number does not match the subject identifier. The sequence and code used will be kept in an encrypted file accessible only to the trial statistician. A physical copy will be kept in a locked cabinet at the CUN, accessible only to the person administering the drug who will not enrol or attend to patient care. A separate set of 24 envelopes for emergency unblinding will be kept in the study file. BLINDING (MASKING): The clinical trial team and the patients will be blinded. The placebo will not be visibly identical, but it will be administered by staff not involved in the clinical care or participant follow up. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): The sample size is 24 patients: 12 participants will be randomised to the treatment group and 12 participants to the control group. TRIAL STATUS: Current protocol version: 1.0 dated 16 of April 2020. Recruitment is envisioned to begin by May 14th and end by June 14th. TRIAL REGISTRATION: EudraCT number: 2020-001474-29, registered April 1(st). Clinicaltrials.gov: submitted, pending number FULL PROTOCOL: The full protocol is attached as an additional file, accessible from the Trials website (Additional file 1).

        "abstract": "Since the first appearance of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS- CoV-2) in China on December 2019, the world has now witnessed the emergence of the SARS- CoV-2 outbreak. Therefore, due to the high transmissibility rate of virus, there is an urgent need to design and develop vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 to prevent more cases affected by the virus. In this study, a computational approach is proposed for vaccine design against the envelope (E) protein of SARS-CoV-2, which contains a conserved sequence feature. First, we sought to gain potential B-cell and T-cell epitopes for vaccine designing against SARS-CoV-2. Second, we attempted to develop a multi-epitope vaccine. Immune targeting of such epitopes could theoretically provide defense against SARS-CoV-2. Finally, we evaluated the affinity of the vaccine to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules to stimulate the immune system response to this vaccine. We also identified a collection of B-cell and T-cell epitopes derived from E proteins that correspond identically to SARS-CoV-2 E proteins. The in-silico design of our potential vaccine against E protein of SARS-CoV-2 demonstrated a high affinity to MHC molecules, and it can be a candidate to make a protection against this pandemic event.",

        "title": "Characteristics and Outcomes of Children With Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Infection Admitted to US and Canadian Pediatric Intensive Care Units.",
        "abstract": "Importance The recent and ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has taken an unprecedented toll on adults critically ill with COVID-19 infection. While there is evidence that the burden of COVID-19 infection in hospitalized children is lesser than in their adult counterparts, to date, there are only limited reports describing COVID-19 in pediatric intensive care units (PICUs). Objective To provide an early description and characterization of COVID-19 infection in North American PICUs, focusing on mode of presentation, presence of comorbidities, severity of disease, therapeutic interventions, clinical trajectory, and early outcomes. Design, Setting, and Participants This cross-sectional study included children positive for COVID-19 admitted to 46 North American PICUs between March 14 and April 3, 2020. with follow-up to April 10, 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures Prehospital characteristics, clinical trajectory, and hospital outcomes of children admitted to PICUs with confirmed COVID-19 infection. Results Of the 48 children with COVID-19 admitted to participating PICUs, 25 (52%) were male, and the median (range) age was 13 (4.2-16.6) years. Forty patients (83%) had significant preexisting comorbidities; 35 (73%) presented with respiratory symptoms and 18 (38%) required invasive ventilation. Eleven patients (23%) had failure of 2 or more organ systems. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was required for 1 patient (2%). Targeted therapies were used in 28 patients (61%), with hydroxychloroquine being the most commonly used agent either alone (11 patients) or in combination (10 patients). At the completion of the follow-up period, 2 patients (4%) had died and 15 (31%) were still hospitalized, with 3 still requiring ventilatory support and 1 receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The median (range) PICU and hospital lengths of stay for those who had been discharged were 5 (3-9) days and 7 (4-13) days, respectively. Conclusions and Relevance This early report describes the burden of COVID-19 infection in North American PICUs and confirms that severe illness in children is significant but far less frequent than in adults. Prehospital comorbidities appear to be an important factor in children. These preliminary observations provide an important platform for larger and more extensive studies of children with COVID-19 infection.",

        "title": "Vaccination against Paediatric Respiratory Pathogens",
        "abstract": "Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) are extremely common in children, especially those under 5 years old. They can lead to complications, super-infection, respiratory failure, and even compromised respiratory function in adulthood. For some of the responsible pathogens, vaccines are available. This review reports current issues about vaccines against the main respiratory pathogens to highlight the available strategies to reduce the burden of paediatric respiratory disease. The optimal use of influenza, pneumococcal, pertussis and measles vaccines is required in order to reduce ARI burden. Vaccination coverage rates must be improved to achieve the full benefits of these vaccines. Recently, advances in the knowledge of respiratory syncytial virus structural biology and immunology as well as the development of new techniques to generate vaccine candidates have increased the number of promising vaccines even against this harmful pathogen.",

        "title": "Relative Efficacy of AS03-Adjuvanted Pandemic Influenza A(H1N1) Vaccine in Children: Results of a Controlled, Randomized Efficacy Trial",
        "abstract": "Background. The vaccine efficacy (VE) of 1 or 2 doses of AS03-adjuvanted influenza A(H1N1) vaccine relative to that of 2 doses of nonadjuvanted influenza A(H1N1) vaccine in children 6 months to <10 years of age in a multinational study conducted during 2010\u20132011. Methods. A total of 6145 children were randomly assigned at a ratio of 1:1:1 to receive 2 injections 21 days apart of A/California/7/2009(H1N1)-AS03 vaccine at dose 1 and saline placebo at dose 2, 2 doses 21 days apart of A/California/7/2009(H1N1)-AS03 vaccine (the Ad2 group), or 2 doses 21 days apart of nonadjuvanted A/California/7/2009(H1N1) vaccine (the NAd2 group). Active surveillance for influenza-like illnesses continued from days 14 to 385. Nose and throat samples obtained during influenza-like illnesses were tested for A/California/7/2009(H1N1), using reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Immunogenicity, reactogenicity, and safety were assessed. Results. There were 23 cases of confirmed 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) (A[H1N1]pdm09) infection for the primary relative VE analysis. The VE in the Ad2 group relative to that in the NAd2 group was 76.8% (95% confidence interval, 18.5%\u201393.4%). The benefit of the AS03 adjuvant was demonstrated in terms of the greater immunogenicity observed in the Ad2 group, compared with the NAd2 group. Conclusion. The 4\u20138-fold antigen-sparing adjuvanted pandemic influenza vaccine demonstrated superior and clinically important prevention of A(H1N1)pdm09 infection, compared with nonadjuvanted vaccine, with no observed increase in medically attended or serious adverse events. These data support the use of adjuvanted influenza vaccines during influenza pandemics. Clinical Trials Registration. NCT01051661.",
